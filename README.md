# Unnamed Framework

A WIP framework for post exploitation, malware research, learning win32 and the native api, and more.

## Current progress

 - Partial implementation of memory and process classes. Users can quickly search for processes, scan their memory, and do basic DLL injection. 
 - Implementation of a few anti-debug techniques in the antidebug class.

---

## Future projects/research

As the framework nears completion, it could be used for various projects like:
 - A challenge binary for anti-debugging techniques
 - Build more advanced meterpreter
 - Research which injection techniques are reliable and stealthy, evaluate against different anti-virus products
 - Would be useful for game hacking
